# Running the Liteflix Project

This guide provides instructions on how to run both the frontend and backend parts of the Liteflix project.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- Yarn (recommended) or npm

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
   Change to the directory where the backend code is located:
```bash
  cd liteflix-api
```


2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all necessary packages using Yarn:

3. **Start the Backend Server:**
   You can start the server:
   - For development:
```bash
  yarn start
```


## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   Change to the directory where the frontend code is located:
```bash
  cd liteflix-frontend
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all necessary packages using Yarn:
```bash
  yarn install
```

3. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
   Start the local server using Vite:
```bash
  yarn dev
```


This will launch the frontend development server, typically accessible via `http://localhost:5173`.

## Accessing the Application
Once both servers are running, you can access the frontend application in your browser at the default address set by Vite, usually `http://localhost:5173`.
